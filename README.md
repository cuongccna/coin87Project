# Coin87

**Coin87 is a real-time crypto news reliability intelligence platform.**

Coin87 aggregates information from multiple free crypto news sources and evaluates
the *reliability*, *persistence*, and *signal quality* of information over time.

Coin87 does **not** predict price.
Coin87 does **not** generate trading signals.
Coin87 exists to answer one question:

> Which crypto news is worth trusting right now?

## Core Philosophy

The crypto market does not suffer from lack of information.
It suffers from lack of **trust in information**.

Coin87 is built on three principles:

- Information must be evaluated, not consumed blindly
- Silence is a feature, not a bug
- Reliability matters more than speed

Coin87 is a **meta-layer** that sits on top of existing news, social,
and on-chain data sources.

## What Coin87 Is NOT

Coin87 is **not**:

- A trading bot
- A signal service
- A price prediction engine
- A buy/sell recommendation platform

Coin87 never tells users what action to take.
It tells users **which information deserves attention**.

---

## What Coin87 Does

Coin87:

- Collects crypto-related news and narratives from multiple free sources
- Groups related mentions into information clusters
- Evaluates each cluster based on:
  - Source credibility
  - Cross-source confirmation
  - Persistence over time
  - Correction and contradiction signals
- Ranks information by **reliability-weighted importance**
- Surfaces only the most meaningful information to users

## Key Concepts

### Information Signal
A discrete piece of information or narrative that emerges across one or more sources.

### Reliability
A measure of how trustworthy an information signal is,
based on behavior over time — not market reaction.

### Source Trust Index
A dynamic score representing how reliable a source has been historically.

### Narrative Lifespan
How long an information signal persists before fading, being corrected, or disproven.

## Product Design Principles

- No infinite feeds
- No price charts
- No trading calls
- No dopamine-driven UI

The UI is designed to be calm, sparse, and decision-oriented.
If there is nothing important, Coin87 shows nothing.

## Project Status

Coin87 is under active development.
The current focus is on **Information Reliability Tracking**
and long-term trust modeling.

## Guiding Rule

If a feature makes Coin87 louder, faster, or more sensational,
it does not belong in this project.

Coin87 exists to help users stay rational in an irrational market.
