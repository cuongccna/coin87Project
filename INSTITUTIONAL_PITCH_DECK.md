# coin87 — Institutional Pitch Deck (12 slides)

## Slide 1 — The Problem (Quiet but Costly)
**Title:** Most investment losses are decision errors, not market errors

- Discretionary decisions are made under:
  - Narrative pressure
  - Timing distortion
  - Consensus bias
- Existing tools increase information flow, not decision quality
- IC discussions are vulnerable to invisible bias and forced urgency

---

## Slide 2 — Why Existing Tools Fail ICs
- News feeds amplify urgency and salience
- Research portals reward activity and breadth
- Dashboards imply action through constant updates
- None preserve decision context at the moment of choice

**Key message:** More information ≠ better decisions

---

## Slide 3 — coin87 Category Definition
**Title:** Decision Risk Infrastructure

- Not a data provider
- Not a research platform
- Not a signal engine

coin87 is:
- A layer that evaluates the **information environment**
- Before discretionary decisions are made

---

## Slide 4 — What coin87 Actually Does
- Detects decision-contaminating information conditions
- Identifies narrative dominance (recurring, cyclical)
- Surfaces consensus pressure (non-price, optics-driven)
- Flags timing distortion windows (information-induced timing error)
- Preserves decision context for later review

---

## Slide 5 — IC Preparation Mode (Differentiator)
- Used **before IC meetings**
- Establishes a shared decision reality (clean / caution / contaminated)
- Slows discussion by making bias risk explicit
- Forces better questions rather than faster answers

**Example IC questions:**
- What evidence would change DELAY → REVIEW today?
- Are we reacting to consensus optics rather than verified facts?
- Which decision can be deferred without breaching governance discipline?

---

## Slide 6 — Institutional Memory (Moat)
- coin87 records:
  - Decision environment at time of decision
  - Known risks present at that time
  - Post-decision reflections (qualitative, governance-focused)

**Key message:** Learning without rewriting history

---

## Slide 7 — Governance & Trust
- Immutable records
- Audit-safe re-evaluation (additive, never corrective-in-place)
- Read-only by design
- No trade execution
- No alpha promises

**Key message:** Built to be trusted, not to be exciting

---

## Slide 8 — Who Uses coin87
- Family Offices
- Discretionary PMs
- CIO / Risk Committees

Explicitly not for:
- Retail traders
- High-frequency strategies
- Signal-driven funds

---

## Slide 9 — Commercial Model
- Sold as governance / risk infrastructure
- Annual contracts
- Not usage-based
- Not performance-based

Cost framed as:
- Insurance against avoidable decision errors

---

## Slide 10 — When coin87 Is Most Valuable
- High narrative environments (recurring themes dominate discussion)
- Consensus-driven markets (pressure to act without evidence)
- Periods of uncertainty (false confidence is most dangerous)
- IC disagreement (process discipline matters most)

**Key message:** coin87 matters most when conviction feels strongest

---

## Slide 11 — What coin87 Does NOT Do
- No buy / sell labels
- No price prediction
- No portfolio advice
- No signal ranking

Purpose:
- Reduce decision risk without creating new incentives to act

---

## Slide 12 — Next Step (Low Commitment)
- Pilot for IC preparation
- Limited scope
- No integration risk (read-only, deterministic outputs)
- Clear evaluation criteria:
  - Fewer forced discussions
  - More explicit “delay” decisions when environment is contaminated
  - Better post-mortem clarity on what was knowable at the time

Tone:
- Calm
- Optional
- No pressure
